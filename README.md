- 👋 Hi, I’m @HaraldurEinarsson
- 👀 I’m interested in developing markdown scripts in RStudio with excellent figures, tables and advanced statistics with clever solutions to improve the scripts or try new statistical methods on data. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GitHub even. I have used it with others but never developed or bin a direct user. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing further some of the markdown scripts I have, but any good work can be better. Hoping GitHub will help to develop this further. 
- 📫 How to reach me;   try haraldur.einarsson@fao.org    if not working (could be in a break) try haraldur@mfri.is
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm working from home in Iceland, about 50 km from an active volcano.
